•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project we were given the starter code that expands into three files which are the GameExperience.py, treasureMaze.py, and our notebook programable document. What I implemented in the project was modifying the qmaze function that will initialize the Q-Learning process. in order for the Q-Learning process to work we declaring  three variables the manage the epoch, episodes, and the action.

•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

The Purpose for Computer Science tackles a large variety of areas, including cybersecurity, data analytics, web development, and networking. Computer science in its core pushes the wheel and creates a path of new innovations that create a better way of life for the further development of society.

o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

In the process of my development as a computer scientist is forming my skill set and understanding on how to translate human thought process in with can be understood computationally by the machine. 

o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical duty as a computer scientist is to ensure that user private information must remain confidential and secured. Having the required technology and security practice implementation that will prevent malicious attacks that will leave users private data compromised. programming encryptions and hashes of private data and implementing validations to prevent input SQL injections.
